Build a face recognition model using faceNet  algorithm

Face recognition is a computer vision task of identifying and verifying a person based on a photograph of their face.

FaceNet is a face recognition system developed in 2015 by researchers at Google that achieved then state-of-the-art results on a range of face recognition benchmark datasets. The FaceNet system can be used broadly thanks to multiple third-party open source implementations of the model and the availability of pre-trained models.

The FaceNet system can be used to extract high-quality features from faces, called face embeddings, that can then be used to train a face identification system.

In this tutorial, you will discover how to develop a face detection system using FaceNet and an SVM classifier to identify people from photographs.
